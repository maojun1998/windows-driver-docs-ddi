# KeReadStateEvent function



## -description
<p>The <b>KeReadStateEvent</b> routine returns the current state, signaled or not-signaled, of an event object.</p>


## -syntax

````
LONG KeReadStateEvent(
  _In_ PRKEVENT Event
);
````


## -parameters
<dl>

### -param <i>Event</i> [in]

<dd>
<p>A pointer to an initialized event object for which the caller provides the storage.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

## -returns
<p>If the event object is currently set to a signaled state, a nonzero value is returned. Otherwise, zero is returned.</p>

## -remarks
<p>This routine provides an efficient way to poll the signal state of an event. <b>KeReadStateEvent</b> reads the state of the event without synchronizing its access to the event. Do not assume that accesses of an event state by <b>KeReadStateEvent</b> are mutually exclusive of accesses by routines, such as <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553253">KeSetEvent</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553350">KeWaitForSingleObject</a>, that do synchronize their access to the event state.</p>

<p>It is also possible to read the state of an event from a driver's interrupt service routine at DIRQL, if the following conditions are met: the driver's event object is resident (probably in its device extension), and any other function that accesses the event synchronizes its access with the ISR.</p>

<p>For more information about event objects, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544323">Event Objects</a>.</p>
